# Frontend Mentor - News homepage solution

This is a solution to the [News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This is the second project I did to practice Tailwind. This time I learned about using CSS grid with Tailwind.
